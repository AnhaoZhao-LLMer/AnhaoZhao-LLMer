Hi, I'm Anhao Zhao, a Ph.D. student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University 🇭🇰🇨🇳, collaborating with EIT, supervised by Prof. [Xiaoyu Shen](https://chin-gyou.github.io/) and Prof. [Wenjie Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/).

I’m an enthusiastic LLM practitioner, aiming to explore the Pareto frontier between accuracy and deployment cost.

My research mainly focuses on  
1) LLM compression,  
2) reasoning efficiency.
