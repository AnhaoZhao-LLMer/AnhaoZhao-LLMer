## Hi there, I'm Anhao Zhao 👋

Hi, I'm Anhao Zhao, a Ph.D. student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University 🇭🇰🇨🇳, collaborating with EIT, supervised by Prof. [Xiaoyu Shen](https://chin-gyou.github.io/) and Prof. [Wenjie Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/).

I’m an enthusiastic LLM practitioner, aiming to explore the Pareto frontier between accuracy and deployment cost.

My research mainly focuses on  
1) LLM compression,  
2) reasoning efficiency.  

- 🍻 Ph.D. at [*NLP Group @PolyU*](https://polyunlp.github.io/) & [*NLP Group @EIT*](https://eit-nlp.github.io/lab-website/).
- 🔭 I'm interested in exploring any feasible research directions toward democratizing large language models (LLMs), making them more accessible, affordable, and widely usable. 
- 💻 Coding with Python, familiar with PyTorch, Transformers.
- 🎧 Big fan of hip-hop (especially CDC and the Chengdu Five 🐼) — feel free to reach out if you wanna chat about rap! 
- 💬 Welcome to contact me by email ↙️.
